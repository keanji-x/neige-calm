//! In-memory `WaveId -> AreaId` cache used by `role_gate::enforce_role`.
//!
//! ## Why a cache
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::card_role_cache::CardRoleCache`] in shape and rationale.
//! The role gate's Worker arm needs to confirm `scope.area == cache.area_of(home_wave)`
//! at every audited write (see #234), and `area_id` lives on the parent
//! `waves` row — not directly addressable from the `CardRoleCache` entry.
//! Putting area on the card cache would denormalize the value across every
//! card row (card-count >> wave-count); a separate `WaveId -> AreaId` map
//! keeps storage proportional to waves.
//!
//! Same write-through invariant:
//!
//!   * `wave_create_tx` calls `cache.insert(wave_id, area_id)` right after
//!     the SQL insert succeeds, *before* the surrounding transaction
//!     commits. A subsequent emit inside the same `write_with_event`
//!     closure therefore sees the freshly-minted wave→area binding without
//!     waiting for the commit.
//!   * `seed_from_db` repopulates the cache at boot from the `waves`
//!     table. Crash safety: any restart sees the persisted `area_id` and
//!     reconstitutes the cache before the first write lands.
//!   * `remove` is called from the wave-delete path so the binding doesn't
//!     linger past the row's lifetime.
//!
//! Area is immutable per wave (`WavePatch` has no `area_id` field; a wave
//! can't migrate areas), so there's no update path to keep in sync.
//!
//! ## What the cache is *not*
//!
//! It is **not** an authorization decision by itself. The decision lives
//! in `role_gate::enforce_role` — the cache is a read-side optimization
//! and a same-tx propagation mechanism. A cache miss at decision time is
//! treated as **deny** by `enforce_role` for Worker `AiCodex` actors
//! (defense in depth — a race between wave-delete and an in-flight emit
//! means the worker is writing into a wave that no longer exists, and
//! we'd rather drop the write than admit a sketchy one).

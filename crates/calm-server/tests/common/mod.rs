//! Shared integration-test support (#293 cutover).
//!
//! Since the shared-daemon cutover, `POST /api/waves` uses the
//! `SharedCodexAppServer` boot path and drives `initialize` / `thread/start` /
//! `turn/start` before returning 201. With no real codex discoverable (e.g.
//! CI, which provisions none) that boot hard-errors and the route returns 500,
//! so every wave-create integration test that asserts 201 would fail.
//!
//! The proven-faithful stand-in is the `osc-probe-child` test fixture: when
//! invoked as `codex app-server ...` it runs `appserver::run_fake_app_server`
//! (see `tests/fixtures/osc-probe-child/appserver.rs`), which binds the
//! socket and answers exactly that handshake (permessage-deflate off, emits
//! `turn/started`) — the same fixture the `theme_osc_roundtrip` tests
//! already rely on. There, the fixture is staged as `codex` via a PATH
//! symlink because the codex-cards path hard-codes the program name and runs
//! it under `sh -c codex`.
//!
//! The wave-create harnesses don't need that PATH dance: the shared-daemon
//! harness invokes `s.codex.codex_bin` directly, so we just point `codex_bin`
//! at the fixture binary. This is deterministic, parallel-safe
//! (no process-global `PATH`/`set_var` mutation), and needs no symlink.
//! Prefer this over installing a real codex into CI.
